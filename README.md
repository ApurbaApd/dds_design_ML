## ML/DL Model to accelerate the discovery and design of drugs of PLGA based Drug Delivery system
### Introduction:
Drug delivery system (DDS) is defined as a formulation or technology designed to
carry medicines or therapeutic substances into the body in a careful and
precise way,enables a therapeutic substance to selectively reach its site of action without reaching the nontarget cells, organs, or tissues
.These systems can also include protective packaging, kind of like tiny shields called micelles
or nanoparticles, that keep the medicine safe and help it go exactly where it's
needed in the body. The main goal of drug delivery systems is to make sure medicines work better,
are safer, and are easier to use. 
Now, A biopolymeic drug delivery system is a type of drug delivery system that uses
biopolymers as the main raw material to design and develop drug carriers or
matrices to control the release of pharmaceutical agents or medication in the
body, Like here PLGA based DDS, being biodegradable and
biocompatible, making it suitable for various medical and pharmaceutical
applications.
However, the interplay between multiple parameters, including the physicochemical properties of the drug and polymer, make it very difÔ¨Åcult to intuitively predict the performance of these systems.

### Objective: 
The primary objective of this is to use machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to accelerate the discovery and design of drugs within poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based drug delivery systems (DDS). ML/DL algorithms can be used to predict experimental drug release from these advanced drug delivery systems.These trained models can be used to guide the design of new PLGA based Drugs. The implementation of the described data-driven approach has the potential to reduce the time and cost associated with drug formulation development.
