## ML/DL Model to accelerate the discovery and design of drugs of PLGA based Drug Delivery system
### Introduction:
A drug delivery system (DDS) is defined as a formulation or technology designed to carry medicines or therapeutic substances into the body in a careful and precise manner, enabling a therapeutic substance to selectively reach its site of action without affecting non-target cells, organs, or tissues. These systems may also include protective packaging, such as tiny shields called micelles or nanoparticles, which safeguard the medicine and facilitate its targeted delivery within the body. The primary goal of drug delivery systems is to enhance the efficacy, safety, and usability of medicines.

Now, a biopolymeric drug delivery system is a type of drug delivery system that utilizes biopolymers as the primary raw material to design and develop drug carriers or matrices for controlling the release of pharmaceutical agents or medication within the body. For instance, PLGA-based DDS, being biodegradable and biocompatible, is suitable for various medical and pharmaceutical applications. However, the complex interplay between multiple parameters, including the physicochemical properties of the drug and polymer, makes it very challenging to intuitively predict the performance of these systems.The application of ML in the pharmaceutical sciences is generally limited by a lack of available open-source datasets to train models.

### Objective: 
The primary objective of this project is to leverage machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to expedite the discovery and design of drugs within poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based drug delivery systems (DDS). ML/DL algorithms will be employed to predict experimental drug release from these advanced drug delivery systems. Subsequently, these trained models can be utilized to inform and guide the design of new PLGA-based drugs. The implementation of this data-driven approach has the potential to significantly reduce the time and cost associated with drug formulation development.

### Discussion:
It is widely known that drug-polymer compatibility significantly influences the performance of a formulation, including aspects such as drug loading capacity, drug release, and stability. The current study embarked on the investigation and refinement of machine learning (ML) models to accurately predict fractional drug release from PLGA based Drugs. To achieve this, a series of ML algorithms were trained and evaluated, including multiple linear regression (MLR), MLR with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regularization (lasso), partial least squares (PLS), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGB),AdaBoost,support vector regressor (SVR), k-nearest neighbors(k-NN), and NN. The RF/XGB models emerged as the top performer, demonstrating exceptional accuracy in predicting fractional drug release.\

Additionally, the study aimed to predict the drug release of proteins and peptides from PLGA-based microparticles (MPs) utilizing a dataset comprising 68 PLGA formulations.
